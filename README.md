# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside its valid range. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.

This exception occurs when an array index is used that is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the array's length. It's a critical error that can lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes. Understanding this exception and how to avoid it is crucial for writing robust Java applications.
